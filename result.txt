===================================Trial Evaluation====================================
 Based on the information provided in the context, it is not possible for me to definitively assess the efficacy of the investigational drug (X93461) for the patient with epilepsy. The reason being that we do not have sufficient information about the specific goals or endpoints of the clinical trial, as well as the baseline seizure frequency and response to other medications.

However, we do know that the patient in Question 1 had no significant cognitive changes during the RCT period, and the seizure frequency remained the same. In contrast, the patient in Question 2 experienced somnolence and diplopia as side effects, and had more frequent seizures (8 in the past 3 months) compared to the first visit.

The assessment and plan sections suggest that the investigational drug will be continued for another three months and closely monitored for response and side effects. Therefore, it is important to follow-up with the patient's progress and evaluate their seizure frequency and severity after this trial period to determine the efficacy of the drug.=======================================================================================
